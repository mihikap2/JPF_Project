1. Explain why your solution is likely correct. Are workers added and executed thread-safe way? Is the access to the shared output file always safe (no attempt to write to a closed file; possible exceptions handled)?

Since we are synchronysing all reads and writes to the downloaders variable in the downloader class,
we are guaranteeing that we do not close the socket, printwriter and inputStream until all data has been read from the server (Lines 222-224 in Downloader).
Another thing that is guaranteed is that we do not close the output stream until all data has been written to the output file (lines 150 - 162).
Since we are not closing the output file unless all downloaders have finished writing to it we are never writing to a closed output file.

Regarding workers in the webServer module, the worker function run is synchronized so every read/write a worker makes is threadsafe, only one worker can operate at a time so all operations made by workers should be threadsafe.

2. What can you say about the resulting system after it has been verified with JPF? Is it proven to be correct? Why (not)?

No, the JPF checker is guaranteeing that there are no race conditions but it is not, for example, the output file is correct. More checks need to be added to be able to confirm that the system is working as intended.
There are exceptions in the code which are being caught and a stack trace printed, but there are no assertions in the exceptions so the checker might let some exceptions pass when it should be failing.
