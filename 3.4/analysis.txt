We start by initializing all threads,
Then we read the first byte into the main download thread, and wait to acquire the output
lock in line 211

Now we read and write everything in the second download thread.
After reading and writing with the second download thread we decrease the number of 
downloaders to 0 (line 151) and wait for access to the output lock in line 153.

The main download thread now acquires the output lock (line 211), the number of downloaders is now 0,
and since the firstChunkOk flag is set to true we return without writing the byte we had read earlier.
Next we continue in the download function, still holding onto the lock we close the output connection and call the oracle.

The oracle fails since we returned from the main download thread without writing to the output file.
